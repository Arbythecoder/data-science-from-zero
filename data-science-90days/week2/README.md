## 💡 Pro Tips for This Week

1. **Type the code yourself** - Don't copy/paste!
2. **Experiment** - Change values and see what happens
3. **Use real data** - Apply to your own spreadsheets
4. **Take notes** - Document what you learn
5. **Ask "why?"** - Understand the reasoning, not just syntax

---

## 🐛 Common Beginner Mistakes

1. **Forgetting to import pandas**: Always start with `import pandas as pd`
2. **Modifying original data**: Use `.copy()` when cleaning
3. **Using `and`/`or` instead of `&`/`|`** in filters
4. **Not resetting index** after dropping rows
5. **Ignoring missing data** - always check with `.isnull().sum()`
