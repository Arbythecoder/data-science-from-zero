## 🎯 New Formulas This Week

```
Text Functions:
=CONCATENATE(A1, " ", B1)    Join text
=LEFT(A1, 5)                  First 5 characters
=RIGHT(A1, 3)                 Last 3 characters
=MID(A1, 2, 4)                4 chars starting at position 2
=TRIM(A1)                     Remove extra spaces
=UPPER(A1)                    MAKE UPPERCASE
=LOWER(A1)                    make lowercase
=PROPER(A1)                   Proper Case

Logical Functions:
=IF(A1>100, "High", "Low")    Conditional logic
=AND(A1>50, B1<100)           Both conditions true
=OR(A1>100, B1>100)           Either condition true

Lookup Function:
=VLOOKUP(A1, B:C, 2, FALSE)   Find matching value
```

## 🚨 Common Week 2 Challenges

**Challenge 1**: "VLOOKUP returns #N/A"
- **Solution**: Value not found, or table range wrong

**Challenge 2**: "My IF statement isn't working"
- **Solution**: Check syntax, quotation marks, parentheses

**Challenge 3**: "Text functions return weird results"
- **Solution**: Check for hidden spaces using TRIM first

**Challenge 4**: "Can't remove duplicates"
- **Solution**: Select entire data range, not just one column

**Don't worry!** Each lesson addresses these in detail.
