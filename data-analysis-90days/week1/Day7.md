## 📝 Part 2: Self-Assessment Quiz

### Section A: Conceptual Understanding

**Question 1**: What's the difference between data and information?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Data is raw facts and figures. Information is processed data with meaning and context.
</details>

**Question 2**: Classify this data: "Customer satisfaction: Very Satisfied"

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Qualitative - Ordinal (because satisfaction levels have a natural order)
</details>

**Question 3**: Why should each variable be in its own column?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
- Makes sorting easier
- Enables filtering
- Allows formulas to work properly
- Makes data analysis possible
</details>

**Question 4**: What's wrong with this structure?
```
Grace, 25, Lagos | John, 30, Abuja
```

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
- Multiple observations in one row
- No column headers
- Data is separated by commas in cells instead of proper columns
</details>

**Question 5**: When should you use descending sort?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
When you want largest/newest first (e.g., highest sales, most recent dates, top scores)
</details>

---

### Section B: Formula Writing

**Write formulas for these tasks** (don't look back!):

**Question 6**: Add numbers in cells A1 through A10

Your answer: ___________________

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
=SUM(A1:A10)
</details>

**Question 7**: Find the average of B5 to B20

Your answer: ___________________

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
=AVERAGE(B5:B20)
</details>

**Question 8**: Count how many numbers are in C1 to C50

Your answer: ___________________

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
=COUNT(C1:C50)
</details>

**Question 9**: Find the highest value in D2 to D100

Your answer: ___________________

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
=MAX(D2:D100)
</details>

**Question 10**: Find the lowest value in E10 to E30

Your answer: ___________________

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
=MIN(E10:E30)
</details>

---

### Section C: Practical Application

**Question 11**: You have this data:
```
   A        B
1  Name     Score
2  Grace    85
3  John     92
4  Sarah    78
5  David    88
```

What formula in cell B6 would calculate the average score?

Your answer: ___________________

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
=AVERAGE(B2:B5)
</details>

**Question 12**: Same data. How would you find who scored highest?

Your process: ___________________

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
1. Use =MAX(B2:B5) to find highest score
2. Sort column B descending
3. Top row shows highest scorer
</details>

**Question 13**: You want to see only scores above 85. What do you use?

Your answer: ___________________

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Filter: Score > 85
</details>

---

### Section D: Error Detection

**Question 14**: What's wrong with this formula? `SUM(A1:A10)`

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Missing the = sign at the beginning. Should be: =SUM(A1:A10)
</details>

**Question 15**: This formula gives #DIV/0! error: `=A1/B1`
Why?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
B1 is either 0 or empty. Division by zero causes this error.
</details>
