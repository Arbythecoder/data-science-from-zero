## 🎯 How to Get Maximum Value

### 1. Don't Just Read - Type It Out
- Copy-pasting teaches nothing
- Type every line of code yourself
- Experiment with changes

### 2. Do Exercises Before Looking at Solutions
- Struggle is part of learning
- Try for at least 15 minutes before checking answers
- Compare your solution to the provided one

### 3. Modify and Extend
- Change the numbers and see what happens
- Add extra columns or calculations
- Apply to your own data

### 4. Build Your Own Projects
- Use the patterns you learn
- Create analyses for your own interests
- Document and share on GitHub

## 🎓 Learning Principles

### 1. Practice > Theory
**Don't** just watch tutorials
**Do** build real projects

### 2. Real Data > Toy Examples
**Don't** use perfect, clean data
**Do** work with messy, real-world datasets

### 3. Understanding > Memorization
**Don't** memorize syntax
**Do** understand concepts

### 4. Consistency > Intensity
**Don't** cram everything in one day
**Do** practice daily for 60-90 minutes
