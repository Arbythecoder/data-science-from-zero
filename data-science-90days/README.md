# 📊 90 Days of Data Science with Arby

**Learn Data Science Through Storytelling** 📖

Welcome to my hands-on 90-day Data Science journey — where every concept is taught through real-world stories and scenarios. No boring theory! Each day includes:
- **Story-driven lessons** that make concepts stick
- **3 practical exercises** based on real scenarios
- **Mini-projects** you can add to your portfolio

This repo is my public learning journal, and you're welcome to follow along or fork and build your own!

## 📚 Tools I'm Using

- Python (Jupyter Notebook + VS Code)
- pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- Git, GitHub
- Streamlit (for dashboards)
- Google Colab

---

## 🎯 Why I'm Doing This

- To stay consistent and accountable
- To teach what I learn in public through storytelling
- To prove that data science is learned best through real-world stories
- To inspire beginners to start without fear

## 📖 The Storytelling Approach

**Why stories?** Because humans learn best through narratives!

Instead of: *"Here's how to use pandas.groupby()"*

We say: *"Imagine you're analyzing your coffee shop's sales. You want to know which drink sells best each day of the week. Let's use groupby() to find out..."*

**Every lesson includes:**
- 📖 **A real-world scenario** (running a business, analyzing sports, tracking health)
- 💡 **The problem to solve** (clear business question)
- 🛠️ **The tools you need** (specific data science techniques)
- ✅ **The solution** (step-by-step code with explanations)
- 🎯 **3 practice exercises** (apply to different stories)

**Learning principles:**
- ✅ Context before code
- ✅ Problems before solutions
- ✅ Stories that relate to your life
- ✅ Practice makes permanent
