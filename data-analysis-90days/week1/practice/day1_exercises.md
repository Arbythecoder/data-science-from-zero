## 🎯 Exercise Set 4: Real-Life Data Hunt

### Your Mission: Find Data Everywhere!

For the next 2 hours, identify and record 15 different pieces of data you encounter.

**Template**:

| # | Data | Source | Type | Classification |
|---|------|--------|------|----------------|
| 1 | Temperature: 28°C | Weather app | Quantitative | Continuous |
| 2 | | | | |
| 3 | | | | |
| 4 | | | | |
| 5 | | | | |

## 🎯 Exercise Set 5: Critical Thinking

### Question 1: Why Does Data Type Matter?

**Scenario**: You're tracking customer ages.

If you store age as:
- **Quantitative (number)**: 25, 30, 45, 22
- **Qualitative (category)**: "Young", "Middle-aged", "Senior"

**Question**: What can you do with quantitative age data that you CAN'T do with categorical age data?

**Your Answer**:

_________________________________________________

_________________________________________________

<details>
<summary>Sample Answer</summary>

With quantitative age data you can:
- Calculate average age
- Find median age
- Determine age range
- Sort precisely by age
- Identify specific age groups (e.g., 25-30)

With categorical data you only know general groups but can't calculate exact statistics.
